# Data API Builder

Data API Builder is designed to simplify the creation of APIs for database operations, but it does have some limitations when it comes to complex queries and logic.

## Complex Queries and Logic

Data API Builder supports basic CRUD operations and simple joins/relationships. However, for more complex queries involving aggregations, advanced analytical functions, or intricate logic, it may not be the best fit. According to the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-api-builder/), complex queries like those involving "group by" or windowing functions are not natively supported. In such cases, creating a view or a stored procedure and then calling it via GraphQL or REST endpoints is recommended.

## Multiple Databases Without Stored Procedures

Data API Builder can work with multiple databases, but it typically requires some configuration. You can define multiple data sources in the configuration file and map them to different entities. However, for complex logic that spans multiple databases, you might need to rely on views or stored procedures to handle the intricate parts of the query.

## Summary

- **Simple Queries**: Data API Builder handles these well.
- **Complex Queries**: Best handled via views or stored procedures.
- **Multiple Databases**: Supported with configuration, but complex logic might need views or stored procedures.

If your project requires handling complex queries and logic without stored procedures, you might want to consider other tools or frameworks that offer more flexibility in this area. FastAPI, for example, allows you to write custom logic in Python, giving you more control over complex operations.
