# 🧱 **Sealed, Partial, and Nested Classes in C#**

> Advanced ways to control, organize, and restrict class usage 🎯

---

## 🔐 1. **`sealed` Class** – Prevent Inheritance

> A `sealed` class **cannot be inherited**.

### Why?

To **lock down** the class behavior — no one can extend or override it.

```csharp
public sealed class FinalLogger
{
    public void Log(string msg) => Console.WriteLine(msg);
}
```

### ❌ Illegal

```csharp
class MyLogger : FinalLogger {} // Error: Cannot derive from sealed class
```

### 💡 Use Cases

- Utility classes
- Prevent overriding critical logic
- Security-sensitive implementations

> ✅ Common in frameworks where behavior must be preserved (e.g., `System.String` is sealed)

---

## 🧩 2. **`partial` Class** – Split Across Files

> A `partial` class lets you **split a class into multiple files** (and C# will treat it as one).

### Why?

- Organize large or auto-generated classes (WinForms, EF Core, etc.)
- Separate logic by purpose (e.g., validation vs. UI vs. data access)

```csharp
// File1: Person.Part1.cs
public partial class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

// File2: Person.Part2.cs
public partial class Person
{
    public void SayHello() => Console.WriteLine($"Hi {Name}");
}
```

Usage:

```csharp
var p = new Person { Name = "Hady" };
p.SayHello(); // ✅ Works fine — compiler merges both parts
```

> ✅ Used heavily by Visual Studio (e.g., WinForms designer code)

---

## 🧱 3. **Nested Classes** – Class Inside Class

> A **nested class** is a class defined **inside another class**.

### Why?

- Group helper/related logic together
- Scope tightly to enclosing class
- Hide implementation from outside

```csharp
public class Outer
{
    private int secret = 42;

    public class Inner
    {
        public void Reveal() => Console.WriteLine("Accessing inner class");
    }
}
```

Usage:

```csharp
Outer.Inner inner = new Outer.Inner();
inner.Reveal();
```

### ⚠️ Access Modifiers Matter

- Nested class can be `private`, `protected`, etc.
- You can hide it completely from outside usage

## 🎓 When to Use Each?

| Modifier     | When to Use                                | Common In                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `sealed`     | Lock class from being inherited            | Libraries, frameworks            |
| `partial`    | Organize big/auto-generated classes        | WinForms, EF, Razor              |
| Nested class | Scope class to be used only inside another | Helpers, DSLs, internal builders |

## 💬 Interview Insight

> "These modifiers help you control class **design boundaries**. `sealed` protects behavior, `partial` improves maintainability, and nested classes organize closely related logic."

## ✅ Summary Table

| Feature   | Purpose                           | Can Inherit? | Can Use Across Files? |
| --------- | --------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| `sealed`  | Prevents further inheritance      | ❌ No        | ❌ No                 |
| `partial` | Split class across multiple files | ✅ Yes       | ✅ Yes                |
| `nested`  | Scope inner class to outer class  | ✅ Yes       | ❌ (scoped to outer)  |
