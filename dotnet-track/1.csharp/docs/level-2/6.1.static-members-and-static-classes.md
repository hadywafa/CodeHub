# ⚡ **Static Members and Static Classes in C#**

## 🧠 What Does `static` Mean in C#?

> `static` means **belonging to the type itself**, not an instance of the type.

- You don’t create an object to use it
- Shared across all instances
- Common in utility/helper logic, global state, constants, and performance-optimized features

---

## 🧱 1. Static Fields

```csharp
public class Counter
{
    public static int TotalCount = 0;
}
```

### Usage

```csharp
Counter.TotalCount++; // ✅ No instance needed
```

> 🔁 Shared across all users of `Counter` class

---

## 🧪 2. Static Methods

```csharp
public class MathUtils
{
    public static int Add(int x, int y) => x + y;
}
```

### Usage

```csharp
int result = MathUtils.Add(3, 5); // ✅ Call without object
```

> ✅ Ideal for **utility operations**, **pure functions**, and **helper methods**

---

## 🧱 3. Static Constructor

Used to **initialize static data** before any static member is accessed.

```csharp
public class Logger
{
    static Logger()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Static constructor called once.");
    }

    public static void Log(string msg)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(msg);
    }
}
```

- Runs **once per type**
- Cannot be called manually
- No parameters allowed

---

## 🧱 4. Static Class

```csharp
public static class Config
{
    public static string AppName = "MyApp";
    public static void Print() => Console.WriteLine(AppName);
}
```

✅ Rules:

- Cannot be instantiated
- All members must be `static`
- Often used for: utilities, constants, global tools

> 💡 **`System.Math`**, `System.Console`, and `Path` are all static classes

## ⚠️ Static vs Instance Members

| Feature        | `static`                            | instance                        |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Belongs to     | The **class itself**                | Each individual **object**      |
| Requires `new` | ❌ No                               | ✅ Yes                          |
| Shared         | ✅ Yes (same value across all)      | ❌ No (unique per object)       |
| Use case       | Common data, utils, global services | Unique data, real-world objects |

## 📛 When to Avoid Static?

| Situation                          | Reason to Avoid `static`          |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| You need multiple object instances | Static = one shared version       |
| You want testability               | Hard to mock static classes       |
| You need dependency injection      | DI containers don’t handle static |

> ⚠️ Static code is **harder to unit test** and **not suitable** for stateful logic or services

---

## 💬 Interview Insight

> "Use `static` for global logic or constants that are **not tied to individual object state**. Avoid overusing it in business logic to keep your code modular and testable."

## ✅ Summary Table

| Feature      | Static                       | Instance                           |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Memory       | Allocated once per AppDomain | Per object                         |
| Constructors | `static ClassName()`         | `public ClassName(...)`            |
| Reusability  | Globally available           | Needs object creation              |
| Use Case     | Utilities, shared state      | Object models, real-world entities |
