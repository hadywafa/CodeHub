# üß† **Value Types vs Reference Types (Stack vs Heap)**

> Understand how your variables live and die in memory üß¨

## üß± What Are Value Types?

> **Value types** hold their **actual data** directly in memory.

### ‚úÖ Examples

- `int`, `bool`, `float`, `DateTime`, `char`, `double`, `enum`, `struct`

```csharp
int a = 5;
int b = a;
b = 10;

Console.WriteLine(a); // üëâ 5 (a and b are separate copies)
```

### üìç Stored in the

- **Stack** (mostly)
- Passed by **value** (copied)

> ‚úÖ Fast allocation, no GC pressure
> ‚ùå Copying large structs can hurt performance

---

## üßæ What Are Reference Types?

> **Reference types** store a **reference (pointer)** to the actual object in memory.

### ‚úÖ Examples

- `class`, `string`, `array`, `object`, `delegate`, `dynamic`

```csharp
User u1 = new User { Name = "Hady" };
User u2 = u1;
u2.Name = "Ali";

Console.WriteLine(u1.Name); // üëâ "Ali" (u1 and u2 point to the same object)
```

### üìç Stored in the

- **Heap** (the object)
- **Stack** (holds the reference/pointer)
- Passed by **reference** (copies the pointer)

> ‚úÖ Shared access
> ‚ùå Managed by Garbage Collector (GC) ‚Äî more overhead

## üß† Stack vs Heap ‚Äì What's the Difference?

| Feature          | Stack                     | Heap                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Memory Size      | Small (fast access)       | Large (slower access)                 |
| Allocation Speed | Very fast (LIFO)          | Slower (GC-managed)                   |
| Lifetime         | Scoped (per method call)  | Until GC decides to collect           |
| Used For         | Value types, method calls | Objects (reference types), large data |
| Thread Safety    | Thread-safe               | Not thread-safe by default            |

> üìå Think of the **stack** as a fast scratchpad
> üìå Think of the **heap** as a big memory warehouse

## üîÅ Assignment Behavior

```csharp
int x = 10;
int y = x;      // Copy the value

Person p1 = new Person();
Person p2 = p1; // Copy the reference
```

> ‚úÖ Value types = copy of the data
> ‚úÖ Reference types = copy of the pointer

## üß™ Bonus: Structs vs Classes in Practice

```csharp
struct Point { public int X, Y; }
class Circle { public int Radius; }

Point a = new Point { X = 1, Y = 1 };
Point b = a; b.X = 5;

Console.WriteLine(a.X); // üëâ 1 ‚Äî value copy

Circle c1 = new Circle { Radius = 10 };
Circle c2 = c1; c2.Radius = 20;

Console.WriteLine(c1.Radius); // üëâ 20 ‚Äî same object
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes

| Mistake                      | Why It Happens                            |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Assuming structs are faster  | Only for small structs (‚â§ 16 bytes ideal) |
| Forgetting reference sharing | Can lead to unexpected side effects       |
| Boxing value types           | Increases GC pressure (see next topic)    |

## üí¨ Interview Insight

> ‚ÄúUnderstanding stack vs heap is critical for memory optimization, avoiding unexpected bugs, and writing high-performance C#. Choose value types for small, immutable data, and reference types for shared, mutable structures.‚Äù

| Feature         | Value Type                  | Reference Type                 |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Stored In       | Stack                       | Heap (object), Stack (pointer) |
| Passed By       | Value (copy)                | Reference (pointer)            |
| GC Managed      | ‚ùå No                       | ‚úÖ Yes                         |
| Default Example | `int`, `DateTime`, `struct` | `class`, `array`, `string`     |
| Performance     | ‚úÖ Fast for small types     | ‚ùå Slower, but flexible        |
