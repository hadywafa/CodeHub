# üß† **Abstraction in C#**

> Using `abstract classes` and `interfaces` to expose only _what_ matters, not _how_ it works

---

## üöÄ What Is Abstraction?

> **Abstraction** is the process of hiding unnecessary details and showing only the **essential features**.

Think of it as:

> "I don‚Äôt care _how_ it works, I just want to know _what_ it does."

## üéØ Real-World Analogy

- You use a car‚Äôs **steering wheel, pedals, and gear shift** ‚Äî you don‚Äôt need to know how the engine or transmission works.
- That‚Äôs **abstraction** ‚Äî **interface of the system**, not implementation.

---

## üß± 1. Abstract Classes

An `abstract class` is:

- A **base class** that **cannot be instantiated**
- Can contain **abstract methods** (no body) and **regular methods**
- Is used to provide **common structure** + force derived classes to implement missing behavior

### üîß Syntax

```csharp
public abstract class Animal
{
    public abstract void MakeSound();  // No body ‚Äì must override
    public void Eat() => Console.WriteLine("Eating...");
}
```

```csharp
public class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void MakeSound() => Console.WriteLine("Bark");
}
```

### ‚ùå You can‚Äôt do this

```csharp
var a = new Animal(); // Error: Cannot instantiate abstract class
```

---

## ‚úÖ When to Use Abstract Class?

Use it when:

- You want to **share common logic** (non-abstract methods)
- You want to **enforce implementation** of certain members in child classes
- You need to **define a base behavior** while letting derived classes customize part of it

---

## üß± 2. Interfaces (Quick Review)

An `interface`:

- Has **no implementation** (until C# 8+ default interface methods)
- Only declares **method/property/event/indexer signatures**
- Is **pure abstraction**

### üîß Syntax

```csharp
public interface IShape
{
    void Draw();
}
```

```csharp
public class Circle : IShape
{
    public void Draw() => Console.WriteLine("Drawing circle");
}
```

‚úÖ A class can implement **multiple interfaces**, but **inherit from only one abstract/base class**

## üß† Abstraction: Interface vs Abstract Class

| Feature               | Interface                        | Abstract Class               |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Inheritance Count     | Multiple allowed                 | Single only                  |
| Method Bodies Allowed | ‚ùå (C# < 8), ‚úÖ optional (C# 8+) | ‚úÖ Yes                       |
| Fields                | ‚ùå No                            | ‚úÖ Yes                       |
| Constructors          | ‚ùå No                            | ‚úÖ Yes                       |
| Use When...           | Behavior contract only           | Shared base logic + contract |

## üí¨ Interview Insight

> "Abstraction is about designing systems around **what they do**, not how they do it. Abstract classes are for shared inheritance, interfaces define a pure contract. You choose based on flexibility and reuse needs."

---

## üß™ Real-World Use Case

### Abstract Class

```csharp
abstract class PaymentProcessor
{
    public void Process()
    {
        Validate();
        Execute(); // Must override
        SendReceipt();
    }

    protected abstract void Execute(); // Abstract method
    private void Validate() => Console.WriteLine("Validated");
    private void SendReceipt() => Console.WriteLine("Receipt sent");
}
```

```csharp
class PaypalProcessor : PaymentProcessor
{
    protected override void Execute() => Console.WriteLine("Processing PayPal...");
}
```

> ‚úÖ This is **template method pattern** ‚Äî shared flow, override core step.

## ‚úÖ Summary Table

| Abstraction Tool | Key Feature                             | Best Use Case                                |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `abstract class` | Partial implementation + enforced rules | Shared logic with required overrides         |
| `interface`      | No implementation (just signatures)     | API contracts, multiple inheritance          |
| Both together    | Allowed in C#                           | Inherit abstract class + implement interface |
