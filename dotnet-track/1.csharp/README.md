# 🧠 C# Full Mastery Roadmap — From Basics to Advanced

We'll divide it into **7 levels**, and each level will contain **topics** (with subtopics where needed) that we’ll go through **sequentially**.

---

## 🔰 LEVEL 1: C# Basics & Language Fundamentals

> Learn the syntax and building blocks of the language.

1. What is C#? .NET vs .NET Core vs .NET 5/6/7/8
2. Project structure and `Main()` method
3. Data types and variables (value vs reference)
4. Operators (arithmetic, logical, bitwise)
5. Control flow (if, switch, loops)
6. Methods and parameters (ref, out, params)
7. Exception Handling (try-catch-finally, throw, custom exceptions)

---

## ⚙️ LEVEL 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in **C#**

> Master classes, objects, and core OOP principles.

1. Classes and Objects
2. Constructors (default, parameterized, static)
3. Inheritance and base/derived classes
4. Encapsulation (access modifiers)
5. Polymorphism (method overriding, virtual/override/new)
6. Abstraction (abstract classes and interfaces)
7. Static members and static classes
8. Sealed, partial, and nested classes
9. Enums and structs

---

## 🧰 LEVEL 3: Advanced C# Language Features

> Explore powerful tools and syntax enhancements.

1. Delegates and Events
2. Anonymous methods & Lambda expressions
3. LINQ (basic to advanced queries)
4. Extension methods
5. Nullable types and null coalescing
6. Tuples and deconstruction
7. Indexers and properties (auto, expression-bodied)
8. Records (vs classes)
9. Pattern matching
10. `dynamic`, `var`, and reflection

---

## 🔄 LEVEL 4: Memory Management, Performance & Async Programming

> Go under the hood and write optimized code.

1. Value types vs Reference types (stack vs heap)
2. Boxing/unboxing and their impact
3. Garbage Collection internals
4. `IDisposable` and the Dispose pattern
5. Async/Await (with examples)
6. Task vs Thread vs ValueTask
7. SynchronizationContext and deadlocks
8. Thread safety and locks (`lock`, `Monitor`, `Mutex`)
9. Span<T>, Memory<T>, and ref structs

---

## 🏗 LEVEL 5: Architecture, SOLID & Design Patterns

> Structure large applications with maintainability in mind.

1. SOLID principles with code examples
2. Dependency Injection (built-in and third-party)
3. Common design patterns:

   - Singleton
   - Factory / Abstract Factory
   - Strategy
   - Repository & Unit of Work
   - Mediator
   - Observer
   - Adapter, Decorator, Facade, etc.

4. Layered Architecture vs Clean Architecture
5. Domain-Driven Design basics (Entities, Aggregates, Value Objects)

---

## 🧪 LEVEL 6: Testing, Debugging & Tools

> Ensure code quality and maintainability.

1. Unit Testing with xUnit, NUnit, MSTest
2. Mocking with Moq
3. Integration vs Unit Tests
4. Code coverage and test strategies
5. Debugging techniques in Visual Studio
6. Logging with Serilog / NLog / Microsoft.Extensions.Logging
7. Performance profiling

---

## 🌐 LEVEL 7: Applied C# in Real Projects (Enterprise & High-Level)

> Real-world features used in production .NET apps.

1. Working with Files, Streams, and Serialization
2. Working with JSON (System.Text.Json, Newtonsoft.Json)
3. Working with Databases (ADO.NET, Dapper, EF Core basics)
4. Building Web APIs (intro only, since this is pure C# focus)
5. Background services and hosted services
6. Reflection and Metadata
7. Source Generators (advanced compiler feature)
8. Code Analyzers and Roslyn
9. Interop with unmanaged code (unsafe, `fixed`, `Span<T>`)
10. Writing high-performance C# (Benchmarks, optimization)

---

### 📌 BONUS: .NET Runtime Internals & Compilation (for experts)

- JIT vs AOT
- IL Code and Disassembling with ILDASM / ILSpy
- CLR pipeline
- Assembly loading and versioning
- Custom Attributes and Metadata inspection
