# 🧠 **Pattern Matching in C#**

> Smart, expressive condition checks using types, values, and structure ✨

---

## 🧠 What is Pattern Matching?

> Pattern Matching allows you to **test and extract information** from a variable using **types, values, and structure** — in a clean and readable way.

✅ Improves switch statements
✅ Removes manual casting
✅ Enables elegant conditions

---

## 🧩 1. Type Pattern (`is` Operator)

```csharp
if (obj is string s)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"It's a string: {s}");
}
```

✅ Pattern matching **checks type** and **casts it safely** in one step.

---

## 🎯 2. `switch` Expression (C# 8+)

> A smarter, expression-based version of `switch`

```csharp
string role = user switch
{
    AdminUser => "Admin",
    GuestUser => "Guest",
    _ => "Unknown"
};
```

✅ Elegant, return-based — great for mapping values

---

## 🧪 3. Property Patterns

> Match based on **nested object properties**

```csharp
if (person is { Age: > 18, Name: "Hady" })
{
    Console.WriteLine("Adult named Hady");
}
```

---

## 🔀 4. Positional Patterns (with `Deconstruct`)

```csharp
public record Point(int X, int Y);

var result = point switch
{
    (0, 0) => "Origin",
    (_, 0) => "X-Axis",
    (0, _) => "Y-Axis",
    _ => "Somewhere else"
};
```

> ✅ Works with **records** or anything that supports `Deconstruct()`.

---

## 🔍 5. Relational Patterns

```csharp
string level = score switch
{
    < 50 => "Fail",
    < 75 => "Pass",
    <= 100 => "Excellent",
    _ => "Invalid"
};
```

✅ Compare values directly with `<`, `>`, `<=`, etc.

---

## 🧠 6. Logical Patterns

```csharp
if (x is > 0 and < 100)
    Console.WriteLine("Between 1 and 99");

if (user is { Role: "Admin" } or { IsSuperUser: true })
    Console.WriteLine("Has access");
```

✅ Combine conditions with `and`, `or`, `not`

---

## 🧬 7. `when` Guard Clauses

> Add **extra conditions** after a match

```csharp
switch (person)
{
    case Person p when p.Age < 18:
        Console.WriteLine("Minor");
        break;
    case Person p:
        Console.WriteLine("Adult");
        break;
}
```

## ✅ Summary Table

| Pattern Type       | Syntax Example                   | Description                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Type Pattern       | `x is string s`                  | Checks and casts                 |
| Property Pattern   | `x is { Age: > 18 }`             | Checks nested props              |
| Positional Pattern | `p switch { (0,0) => "Origin" }` | Deconstruct + match positionally |
| Logical Pattern    | `x is > 0 and < 100`             | Combine conditions               |
| `when` Guard       | `case x when x > 5:`             | Extra condition in switch        |

## 💬 Interview Insight

> “Pattern matching makes C# more expressive and declarative — especially with records, deconstruction, and smart conditionals. It’s ideal for modeling domain logic and writing cleaner `switch`-like flows.”

## 🧠 Real-World Analogy

- Old Way: "If `obj` is a car and it's a Toyota and it's red, then…"
- Pattern Matching: "If `obj is Car { Brand: "Toyota", Color: "Red" }` then…"
