# ⚡ **Anonymous Methods & Lambda Expressions in C#**

> Writing functions without names — cleaner, inline logic 🎯

---

## 🧠 What Are Anonymous Methods?

> An **anonymous method** is a method **without a name**.
> It’s written **inline**, usually to be passed into a delegate.

---

### 🧱 Classic Anonymous Method Syntax (pre-C# 3.0)

```csharp
Action<string> log = delegate(string msg)
{
    Console.WriteLine(msg);
};

log("Hello Hady!");
```

> 💡 Used for **quick, one-time logic** — no need to create a full method!

---

## 🪄 Lambda Expressions – Modern Syntax (C# 3.0+)

> Lambda = Clean, concise way to write **inline functions**

```csharp
Action<string> log = msg => Console.WriteLine(msg);
```

✅ It's equivalent to:

```csharp
void Log(string msg) => Console.WriteLine(msg);
```

### Basic Syntax

```csharp
(parameters) => expression_or_block
```

### Examples

| Signature  | Lambda Expression                   |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| No param   | `() => Console.WriteLine("Hi")`     |
| One param  | `x => x * 2`                        |
| Two params | `(x, y) => x + y`                   |
| Full block | `x => { var r = x * 2; return r; }` |

## 🧪 Use Case with `Func`, `Action`, `Predicate`

```csharp
Func<int, int> square = x => x * x;
Action<string> greet = name => Console.WriteLine($"Hello {name}");
Predicate<int> isOdd = x => x % 2 != 0;
```

## 💡 Why Use Lambdas?

| Benefit       | Explanation                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 🔍 Concise    | Less boilerplate                   |
| 🚀 Reusable   | Easily pass functions to methods   |
| 🧱 Composable | Combine into LINQ, filters, events |

---

## 📦 Lambdas + Events

```csharp
button.Clicked += () => Console.WriteLine("Clicked anonymously!");
```

> ✅ Super clean, no method declaration needed

---

## 🧠 Lambdas Are Closures

> Lambdas **remember variables** from the scope they’re created in!

```csharp
int counter = 0;
Action increment = () => counter++;

increment();
Console.WriteLine(counter); // 👉 1
```

> 🔁 Lambdas **capture state** — this is called a **closure**

---

## 🔥 Expression-bodied Members

> Lambdas inspired **shortened syntax** for class members:

```csharp
public int Age => DateTime.Now.Year - BirthYear;
public string SayHello() => "Hi!";
```

---

## 🧠 Interview Insight

> "Anonymous methods and lambdas give you elegant ways to pass logic around in C#. They’re the foundation for LINQ, async workflows, and functional-style programming."

## ✅ Summary Table

| Concept             | Example                        | Use Case                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Anonymous Method    | `delegate(string msg) { ... }` | Legacy or explicit logic |
| Lambda Expression   | `x => x * 2`                   | Shorter inline logic     |
| Captures variables? | ✅ Yes (closure)               | Track state across calls |
| Replaces            | Full delegate method syntax    | ✅ Yes                   |

## 🧩 Real-World Analogy

- **Named method** = A pre-written manual
- **Lambda** = A sticky note with quick instructions
- **Closure** = That sticky note remembers the room it was written in 🧠
