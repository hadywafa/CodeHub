# 🔁 Topic 5: Control Flow in **C#**

> 🎯 Mastering `if`, `switch`, and all loop types: `for`, `foreach`, `while`, `do-while`

---

## 🧠 What Is Control Flow?

Control flow determines **how your program executes** — whether it goes straight, branches, or loops.

Think of it like **a train track**:

- 🚂 If-statements are like forks (go left or right)
- 🔁 Loops are like circular tracks (go around until condition breaks)
- 🔁 Switches direct the train to different paths based on values

---

## 🧪 1. `if`, `else if`, `else`

```csharp
int age = 20;

if (age >= 18)
    Console.WriteLine("Adult");
else if (age >= 13)
    Console.WriteLine("Teen");
else
    Console.WriteLine("Child");
```

✅ You can:

- Chain as many `else if` as needed
- Nest ifs
- Use braces `{}` or skip them for one-liners (but brackets are best practice)

> 🧠 Tip: Always keep logic **readable**, not clever.

---

## 🎚️ 2. `switch` (Modern Pattern Matching + Classic)

Classic style:

```csharp
int day = 3;

switch (day)
{
    case 1:
        Console.WriteLine("Mon");
        break;
    case 2:
    case 3:
        Console.WriteLine("Tue or Wed");
        break;
    default:
        Console.WriteLine("Unknown");
        break;
}
```

Modern `switch` expression (C# 8+):

```csharp
string result = day switch
{
    1 => "Mon",
    2 => "Tue",
    3 => "Wed",
    _ => "Unknown"
};
```

### 🧠 Modern benefits

- Cleaner, **expression-based**
- Supports **patterns** (type + conditions)
- No `break` needed!

> ⚠️ Don't forget `_` means "default".

---

## 🔁 3. `for` Loop

Best for known-range iteration.

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"i = {i}");
}
```

| Section     | Role             |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| `int i = 0` | Initialization   |
| `i < 5`     | Condition (run?) |
| `i++`       | Increment step   |

> 🔄 Can increment/decrement by any value (e.g., `i += 2`, `i--`)

---

## 🌀 4. `while` Loop

Runs **while condition is true**.

```csharp
int count = 0;
while (count < 3)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Hello");
    count++;
}
```

> ⚠️ Be careful not to create infinite loops! Always update your condition variable.

---

## 🔁 5. `do-while` Loop

Runs **at least once**, then repeats **while condition is true**.

```csharp
int count = 0;
do
{
    Console.WriteLine("Welcome!");
    count++;
}
while (count < 3);
```

### 📌 Use Case

When you want to **prompt user input once**, then loop only if needed.

---

## 🔄 6. `foreach` Loop

Perfect for **collections/arrays**.

```csharp
string[] names = { "Ali", "Hady", "Sara" };

foreach (var name in names)
{
    Console.WriteLine(name);
}
```

> 🧠 Read-only loop (no index access by default).

---

## 🔂 Bonus: Loop Control Keywords

| Keyword    | Use Case                                  |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `break`    | Exit the loop early                       |
| `continue` | Skip current iteration, go to next        |
| `return`   | Exit current `method` entirely            |
| `goto`     | Jump to a label (⚠️ avoid for clean code) |

### Example

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    if (i == 3) break;       // exit loop at 3
    if (i == 1) continue;    // skip 1
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```

---

## 🧩 Real-World Example

Let’s say you’re checking user logins:

```csharp
List<string> users = new List<string> { "admin", "guest", "user" };
string input = Console.ReadLine();

if (users.Contains(input))
{
    Console.WriteLine("Welcome!");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Access denied.");
}
```

> ✅ This combines control flow with collections — very common in apps!

---

## 🧠 Interview Insight

> “Control flow structures are the foundation of decision-making and iteration. Knowing when to use `for` vs `foreach`, and understanding the readability benefits of modern `switch` expressions, sets you apart in writing clean and maintainable logic.”

## ✅ Summary Table

| Structure   | Purpose                   | Best Use                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `if / else` | Condition-based decisions | Simple branching logic            |
| `switch`    | Multiple discrete values  | Enums, clean pattern matching     |
| `for`       | Counted iterations        | When index or range is important  |
| `while`     | Repeat while true         | Condition-based looping           |
| `do-while`  | Run at least once         | Input prompts, retry loops        |
| `foreach`   | Loop over collections     | Arrays, lists, dictionaries, etc. |
