# 🌐 **“REST API Mastery: From Fundamentals to Enterprise-Grade Practices”**

This single topic title is broad enough to **cover everything** REST-related, and you can study it step by step.

## 🗂️ Suggested Outline (from basics → advanced)

### **1. REST API Basics**

- What is an API? What is REST?
- REST vs SOAP vs GraphQL
- HTTP basics (methods, headers, status codes)
- Request/response lifecycle
- CRUD operations with REST

---

### **2. Designing REST APIs**

- Resources and URIs
- HTTP methods & idempotency (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Query parameters, path parameters, and request bodies
- Status codes (200, 201, 204, 400, 404, 500…)
- Content negotiation (JSON, XML, etc.)

---

### **3. REST API Best Practices**

- Consistent naming conventions
- Versioning strategies (URI, header, query param)
- Pagination, filtering, and sorting
- Error handling (problem+json, error codes)
- HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)

---

### **4. Authentication & Authorization**

- API keys vs OAuth2 vs JWT vs Basic Auth
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- OpenID Connect integration
- Refresh tokens and token expiry

---

### **5. Advanced Data Handling**

- Caching (ETag, Last-Modified, Cache-Control)
- Rate limiting & throttling
- Bulk operations (batch endpoints)
- File uploads/downloads in REST APIs

---

### **6. Testing REST APIs**

- Unit testing controllers & services
- Integration testing with in-memory servers
- Contract testing (e.g., Pact)
- API testing tools (Postman, Newman, REST Assured)

---

### **7. Documentation & Discoverability**

- OpenAPI/Swagger specification
- API documentation generators
- Interactive API docs
- API client SDK generation

---

### **8. Security for REST APIs**

- HTTPS everywhere
- Preventing injection attacks
- Handling CORS
- Rate limiting & DDoS protection
- OWASP API Security Top 10

---

### **9. Performance & Scalability**

- Asynchronous APIs (long polling, webhooks, SSE)
- Caching with Redis/CDN
- API Gateway patterns
- Circuit breakers & retries
- N+1 query problem in APIs

---

### **10. Monitoring & Observability**

- Logging & structured logs
- Metrics & tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- Health checks
- API analytics

---

### **11. REST APIs in the Cloud & Enterprise**

- API Gateways (Kong, Apigee, AWS API Gateway, Azure API Management)
- Service mesh & REST APIs (Istio, Linkerd)
- Rate-limiting at scale
- Governance & policy enforcement
- Multi-region deployments

---

### **12. Beyond REST**

- REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC
- When REST fails (streaming, real-time events)
- Event-driven APIs with REST + Webhooks
- Future of APIs (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, API-first development)
