# 🧬 Polymorphism in Java — With Examples & Smart Explanations

> ✅ **Polymorphism** means: _"one name, many forms."_
> It’s a core concept of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, and Java supports it through **method overloading** (compile-time polymorphism) and **method overriding** (runtime polymorphism).

---

## 🚦 What is Polymorphism?

📖 _Polymorphism_ = "Poly" (many) + "Morph" (forms)

> In Java, polymorphism allows **a single method name or object reference** to behave differently based on the **context**, such as input types or the object's actual class.

👨‍🔧 Real-world example:
A **Vehicle** could be a **bike**, **car**, or **truck**. You call `start()` on all of them, but each behaves differently.

## ✅ Why Use Polymorphism?

| Benefit 🧠                   | Description                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 🔁 Code Reusability          | Write once, use many ways                       |
| 🧼 Cleaner Syntax            | Use the same method name for multiple behaviors |
| 🔗 Extensibility             | Easily plug in new behavior                     |
| 🎯 Interface-driven coding   | Helps in abstraction and modular design         |
| 🧪 Plug-and-play third-party | Makes libraries and APIs replaceable            |

## 🧰 Types of Polymorphism in Java

Java supports **2 types of polymorphism**:

| Type                | Also Known As        | Technique Used     |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| **1. Compile-Time** | Static Polymorphism  | Method Overloading |
| **2. Runtime**      | Dynamic Polymorphism | Method Overriding  |

---

## ⚙️ 1. Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)

> 📌 _Same method name, different parameter list_

This is the easiest form — commonly used for **utility methods, service APIs**, etc.

### 💡 Simple Example: NotificationService

```java
class NotificationService {
    public void send(String email) {
        System.out.println("Sending email to: " + email);
    }

    public void send(String phoneNumber, boolean isSms) {
        System.out.println("Sending SMS to: " + phoneNumber);
    }

    public void send(Object unknown) {
        System.out.println("Unknown notification type for: " + unknown);
    }
}
```

### 🧪 Usage:

```java
NotificationService service = new NotificationService();
service.send("john@example.com");       // email
service.send("+1234567890", true);      // SMS
service.send(12345);                    // unknown
```

## 🧠 2. Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding — Enterprise Style)

> 📌 Method behavior is selected based on **object type at runtime**,
> Common in service classes, strategies, payment processors, data access layers, etc.

Let’s design a **Payment Gateway** with multiple payment processors:

---

### 👇 Step 1: Define a Base Interface

```java
public interface PaymentProcessor {
    void process(PaymentRequest request);
}
```

---

### 👇 Step 2: Create a Request Model

```java
public class PaymentRequest {
    private double amount;
    private String currency;

    public PaymentRequest(double amount, String currency) {
        this.amount = amount;
        this.currency = currency;
    }

    public double getAmount() { return amount; }
    public String getCurrency() { return currency; }
}
```

---

### 👇 Step 3: Create Subclasses (Override Behavior)

```java
public class CreditCardProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    @Override
    public void process(PaymentRequest request) {
        System.out.println("Processing credit card payment: " +
            request.getAmount() + " " + request.getCurrency());
    }
}

public class PayPalProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    @Override
    public void process(PaymentRequest request) {
        System.out.println("Processing PayPal payment: " +
            request.getAmount() + " " + request.getCurrency());
    }
}
```

---

### 👇 Step 4: Main Class (Polymorphic Behavior)

```java
public class PaymentApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PaymentRequest request = new PaymentRequest(99.99, "USD");

        PaymentProcessor processor;

        processor = new CreditCardProcessor();  // runtime binding
        processor.process(request);             // CreditCardProcessor version

        processor = new PayPalProcessor();      // runtime binding
        processor.process(request);             // PayPalProcessor version
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Output

```ini
Processing credit card payment: 99.99 USD
Processing PayPal payment: 99.99 USD
```

### 🔥 Real-World Relevance:

- This design is **framework-ready**
- Works perfectly in **Spring Boot** using `@Service` + `@Autowired`
- Easily extendable (add Stripe, ApplePay, etc.)
- Based on **interface-driven architecture**

---

### 🧠 Why This Is Runtime Polymorphism?

| 🔍 Reference Type | `PaymentProcessor` (interface)                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📦 Actual Object  | Could be `CreditCardProcessor`, `PayPalProcessor`, etc. |
| 🤖 JVM decides    | _at runtime_ which `.process()` to invoke               |

✅ **This is true polymorphism**: multiple forms of a method, chosen dynamically.

| Location             | Same class                              | Parent/Child class                     |
| Real Use Case        | Utility/API variants                    | Strategy patterns, service classes     |
| Example              | `send(...)` method in different formats | `process()` for multiple payment types |
