# üêß **Shell Scripting in Linux: Making Scripts Executable & Running Anywhere**

Shell scripting is a powerful tool for automating tasks in Linux. This guide covers how to write, execute, and make a shell script accessible from anywhere in the system.

---

## üîπ **1. Writing and Executing Shell Scripts**

A shell script is a text file containing a sequence of commands that the shell can interpret.

### ‚úÖ **1.1. Creating a Basic Script**

To create a shell script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, world!"
```

- The first line (`#!/bin/bash`) is called a **shebang** and tells the system to use the Bash shell to interpret the script.
- The script prints `"Hello, world!"` to the terminal.

### ‚úÖ **1.2. Saving and Running the Script**

Save the file with a `.sh` extension (e.g., `myscript.sh`).

To execute the script:

```bash
bash myscript.sh
```

Alternatively, make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x myscript.sh
./myscript.sh
```

---

## üîπ **2. Making a Script Executable from Anywhere**

By default, a script can only be executed from its directory using `./`. To run it from anywhere, follow these steps:

### ‚úÖ **2.1. Moving the Script to a System Path**

Move the script to a directory included in the `PATH` environment variable, such as `/usr/local/bin/` or `$HOME/bin/`.

```bash
mv myscript.sh /usr/local/bin/
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/myscript.sh
```

Now, you can run it from anywhere just by typing:

```bash
myscript.sh
```

### ‚úÖ **2.2. Adding a Custom Directory to `PATH`**

Instead of moving the script, you can add your scripts directory to `PATH`.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a custom `bin` directory in your home folder (if it doesn't exist):

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/bin
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Move the script to this directory:

```bash
mv myscript.sh $HOME/bin/
chmod +x $HOME/bin/myscript.sh
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Add `bin` to `PATH` (temporary for current session):

```bash
export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ Make it permanent by adding the line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
```

5Ô∏è‚É£ Apply changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now, you can run `myscript.sh` from any location.

---

## üîπ **3. Checking and Managing the `PATH` Variable**

### ‚úÖ **3.1. Checking If Your Script is in `PATH`**

To check if your script is available in `PATH`, run:

```bash
which myscript.sh
```

If the script is found, the command outputs its full path.

### ‚úÖ **3.2. Listing All Directories in `PATH`**

```bash
echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n'
```

This displays all directories where the system looks for executable scripts.

---

## üîπ **4. Running Scripts Without the `.sh` Extension**

To run the script without typing `.sh`, remove the extension:

```bash
mv $HOME/bin/myscript.sh $HOME/bin/myscript
```

It will now be executed simply by running:

```bash
myscript
```

---

## üîπ **5. Automating Execution with Cron Jobs**

### ‚úÖ **5.1. Running a Script at a Specific Time**

Use `cron` to schedule script execution. Open the crontab editor:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add a line to run the script every day at 7 AM:

```bash
0 7 * * * /path/to/myscript.sh
```

### ‚úÖ **5.2. Running a Script on Startup**

To execute the script at system startup, add it to `/etc/rc.local` (for older Linux) or use systemd services.
