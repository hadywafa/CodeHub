# 🧩 Interface in Java — The "Contract" Between Classes

## 🧠 What is an Interface?

> ✅ **Official Definition**:
> An **interface** in Java is a **completely abstract type** that defines a **contract**: a set of methods that implementing classes _must_ provide.

It’s like saying: “Hey, if you want to be a `Shape`, you must promise to implement `area()` and `volume()`.”

- Think of an interface as **a blueprint** 🧬, not an implementation.
- All methods in an interface are **public** and **abstract** by default.
- All variables are **public static final** (constants).

---

## 🧰 Why Use Interfaces?

1. ✅ To support **multiple inheritance** (Java doesn't allow multiple class inheritance).
2. ✅ To achieve **loose coupling** (decouple the "what" from the "how").
3. ✅ To define a **shared contract** between different classes (e.g., all types of Shapes should have `area()` and `volume()`).

---

## 🏗️ Interface Syntax

```java
interface Shape {
    double area();
    double volume();
}
```

- No method body here!
- All methods are implicitly `public abstract`.

---

## 👨‍🔧 Implementing an Interface

```java
class Cube implements Shape {
    int x = 10;

    public double area() {
        return 6 * x * x;
    }

    public double volume() {
        return x * x * x;
    }
}
```

- You must implement **all methods** from the interface.
- All implementations must be **public** because the interface method is public.

---

## 🎯 Real Example: Shape Interface

```java
interface Shape {
    double area();
    double volume();
}

class Cube implements Shape {
    int side = 5;

    public double area() {
        return 6 * side * side;
    }

    public double volume() {
        return side * side * side;
    }
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    int radius = 7;

    public double area() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }

    public double volume() {
        return 0; // 2D object
    }
}
```

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape s1 = new Cube();
        Shape s2 = new Circle();

        System.out.println("Cube area: " + s1.area());
        System.out.println("Circle area: " + s2.area());
    }
}
```

## 🔁 Interface vs Abstract Class

| Feature             | Interface                         | Abstract Class                        |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Inheritance         | Supports **multiple inheritance** | Supports **single inheritance**       |
| Method types        | Only **abstract** (until Java 7)  | **Abstract and concrete**             |
| Fields              | `public static final` only        | Can be any access modifier            |
| Constructor         | ❌ No constructor                 | ✅ Can have constructors              |
| Implementation code | ❌ Not allowed (until Java 8)     | ✅ Allowed                            |
| Use case            | Declare **what to do**            | Declare **what and partly how to do** |

---

## ⚙️ Multiple Interfaces

```java
interface A {
    void methodA();
}

interface B {
    void methodB();
}

class MyClass implements A, B {
    public void methodA() {
        System.out.println("Method A");
    }

    public void methodB() {
        System.out.println("Method B");
    }
}
```

This is how Java does **multiple inheritance** ✅ (only for behavior, not fields).

## 📌 Key Rules of Interface

| Rule | Description                                                                                 |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅   | All methods are `public abstract` (even if not declared explicitly)                         |
| ✅   | All fields are `public static final`                                                        |
| ❌   | You cannot instantiate an interface                                                         |
| ❌   | No constructors                                                                             |
| ✅   | A class can implement multiple interfaces                                                   |
| ✅   | An interface can extend multiple interfaces                                                 |
| ❌   | You cannot declare interface methods as `private`, `protected`, or `final`                  |
| ✅   | A class implementing an interface must override **all** its methods or be declared abstract |

## 🧪 Example with Multiple Inheritance

```java
interface Engine {
    void start();
}

interface AC {
    void cool();
}

class Car implements Engine, AC {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine starting...");
    }

    public void cool() {
        System.out.println("Cooling system active...");
    }
}
```

## 💡 Real-World Analogy

> An **interface** is like a **remote control interface** for a TV.
> It tells you: “Here’s what you can do: `powerOn()`, `volumeUp()`”.
> But it doesn't care _how_ the TV is built internally. Any TV brand (class) must implement the interface in their own way.

---

## 🔐 Interface Access Control

- All methods → `public` (cannot be private/protected)
- All variables → `public static final` (constants)
- Interface itself can be `public` or `package-private`

---

## 🧩 When to Use Interface?

Use an interface when:

- You want to **enforce a contract** between unrelated classes (e.g., `Comparable`, `Serializable`)
- You want to **decouple logic** (like Service layer contracts in Spring Boot)
- You need to **support multiple inheritance**

---

## 🎁 Summary

- Interface = 100% abstract
- Used for multiple inheritance and defining contracts
- Cannot contain logic (except `default` methods in Java 8+)
- Classes must implement all interface methods
