# 🔗 **Delegates and Events in C#**

> Function pointers with type safety — the C# way 🧠

---

## 🧠 What Are Delegates?

> A **delegate** is a type-safe **function pointer** — it holds references to methods and lets you pass them around like variables.

✅ You can:

- Store methods in variables
- Pass methods as arguments
- Combine multiple methods (multicast)
- Build event systems

---

## 🧱 1. Declaring a Delegate

```csharp
public delegate void Logger(string message);
```

> This means: any method that returns `void` and accepts a `string` can be stored in this delegate.

---

## ✍️ 2. Using a Delegate

```csharp
public class MyApp
{
    public static void LogToConsole(string msg)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"[Console] {msg}");
    }

    public static void Main()
    {
        Logger logger = LogToConsole; // ✅ Assign method to delegate
        logger("Hello, Hady!");       // ✅ Invoke like a method
    }
}
```

---

## 🧠 Why Are Delegates Powerful?

| Scenario             | Benefit                           |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Callback functions   | Let the caller inject logic       |
| Plugin architectures | Load and invoke logic dynamically |
| UI programming       | Wire up click events, handlers    |
| Event broadcasting   | One-to-many communication         |

---

## 🧪 3. Multicast Delegates

> You can **combine multiple methods** using `+=`:

```csharp
Logger logger = LogToConsole;
logger += msg => Console.WriteLine($"[Debug] {msg}");

logger("Testing");
// Both methods get called ✅
```

---

## 🧱 4. Built-in Delegate Types

C# gives you **generic delegates** so you don’t need to define your own every time:

| Delegate Type      | Signature       | Use Case            |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ------------------- |
| `Action<T>`        | No return value | For `void` methods  |
| `Func<T, TResult>` | Returns a value | Methods with return |
| `Predicate<T>`     | Returns bool    | Filter conditions   |

```csharp
Action<string> log = Console.WriteLine;
Func<int, int, int> add = (x, y) => x + y;
Predicate<int> isEven = x => x % 2 == 0;
```

---

## 📣 5. What Are Events?

> An **event** is a **wrapper around a delegate**, used to signal that “something happened.”

It allows:

- Subscribers to register methods
- The publisher to notify them safely

---

## 🧱 Declaring and Using Events

```csharp
public class Button
{
    public event Action Clicked;

    public void SimulateClick()
    {
        Clicked?.Invoke();  // Safe call
    }
}
```

### Subscriber

```csharp
var btn = new Button();
btn.Clicked += () => Console.WriteLine("Button clicked!");

btn.SimulateClick(); // 👉 Triggers the event
```

---

## 🔐 Why Use `event` Instead of Raw Delegate?

| Reason         | Explanation                                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Encapsulation  | Prevents overwriting full delegate from outside |
| Safe Multicast | Add/remove only, no reset                       |
| Intent         | Signals “you should subscribe”                  |

---

## ✅ Summary: Delegate vs Event

| Concept     | Delegate                          | Event                               |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Purpose     | Reference to method(s)            | Notify subscribers                  |
| Use         | Callbacks, strategies             | Event systems, observers            |
| `+=` / `-=` | ✅ Add/remove methods             | ✅ Works for event too              |
| Direct call | ✅ Can invoke directly            | ❌ Can only invoke inside publisher |
| Example     | `Logger log = Console.WriteLine;` | `public event Action Clicked;`      |

## 🧠 Interview-Ready Quote

> “Delegates allow behavior to be treated as data — they’re C#’s type-safe function pointers. Events build on delegates to implement observer-like publish/subscribe patterns.”

---

## ✅ Real-World Analogy

- **Delegate** = Someone you trust with a job (like calling a function)
- **Event** = Ringing a bell 🔔 to notify all nearby listeners that something happened
