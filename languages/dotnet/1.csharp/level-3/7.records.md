# üßæ Topic 8 (Level 3): **Records vs Classes in C#**

> Immutable, value-based types for clean and reliable data models üîê

## üß† What Is a Record?

> A **record** is a **reference type** introduced in C# 9+ that is optimized for **storing data**, **immutability**, and **value-based equality**.

### üîë Key Differences from Class

| Feature      | Class              | Record                              |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Equality     | Reference-based    | Value-based                         |
| Immutability | Mutable by default | Immutable by default (`init`)       |
| Syntax       | Verbose            | Very concise                        |
| Use Case     | Behavior + state   | Data modeling / DTOs / immutability |

## üß± 1. Declaring a Record

```csharp
public record Person(string FirstName, string LastName);
```

That‚Äôs it! This automatically gives you:

- Constructor
- Properties with `init` setters
- Value equality
- `ToString()`
- `Deconstruct()`
- `with` expression support

---

### ‚úÖ Usage

```csharp
var p1 = new Person("Hady", "Wafa");
var p2 = new Person("Hady", "Wafa");

Console.WriteLine(p1 == p2); // üëâ true (compares values)
```

---

## üß¨ 2. Records Are Immutable by Default

```csharp
public record Car
{
    public string Brand { get; init; }
    public int Year { get; init; }
}
```

```csharp
var c = new Car { Brand = "BMW", Year = 2020 };
// c.Year = 2021; ‚ùå Error ‚Äî init-only!
```

> ‚úÖ `init` allows setting properties only during initialization or in object initializers

---

## üîÅ 3. Using the `with` Expression

> Create a **copy of a record** with **some properties changed**:

```csharp
var original = new Person("Hady", "Wafa");
var modified = original with { FirstName = "Ahmed" };

Console.WriteLine(modified); // üëâ Person { FirstName = Ahmed, LastName = Wafa }
```

---

## üß™ 4. Deconstruction Built In

```csharp
var person = new Person("Hady", "Wafa");
var (first, last) = person;
Console.WriteLine($"{first} {last}"); // Hady Wafa
```

---

## üîí 5. Value Equality

Unlike classes, which compare by reference:

```csharp
var c1 = new Car { Brand = "Audi", Year = 2022 };
var c2 = new Car { Brand = "Audi", Year = 2022 };

Console.WriteLine(c1 == c2); // ‚úÖ true (same content)
```

---

## üß± 6. Records Can Be Classes or Structs

- Default: `record` = reference type
- Use `record struct` for value types with value equality

```csharp
public record struct Point(int X, int Y);
```

> ‚úÖ Behaves like a struct but with record-style syntax and equality

---

## üîç When to Use `record` vs `class`

| Use `record` When...                           | Use `class` When...                            |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| You care about **data identity**               | You care about **object identity**             |
| You want **immutable models** (DTOs, settings) | You want mutable state and behavior            |
| You want built-in equality + `with` support    | You need inheritance or complex business logic |

## üí¨ Interview Insight

> ‚ÄúRecords simplify your data modeling by giving you equality, deconstruction, immutability, and clean syntax ‚Äî perfect for DTOs, API responses, and functional-style logic.‚Äù

## ‚úÖ Summary Table

| Feature    | `class`                | `record`                           |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Type       | Reference              | Reference (or value with `struct`) |
| Equality   | Reference              | Value-based                        |
| Mutability | Mutable                | Immutable by default               |
| Syntax     | Verbose                | Concise                            |
| Use For    | Behavior-heavy objects | Data-only or functional records    |
