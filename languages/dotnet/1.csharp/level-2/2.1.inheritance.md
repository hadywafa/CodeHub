# 🧬 **Inheritance in C#**

> 🚀 Working with `base` and `derived` classes like a pro

---

## 🧠 What Is Inheritance?

> **Inheritance** allows you to **create new classes (derived)** that **reuse** or **extend** functionality from **existing classes (base)**.

It's like saying:

> “This new class **is a kind of** that old class.”

🔁 It helps with:

- Code reuse
- Logical hierarchy
- Extensibility

## 🧱 Basic Syntax

```csharp
public class Animal  // Base class (Parent)
{
    public void Eat()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Eating...");
    }
}

public class Dog : Animal  // Derived class (Child)
{
    public void Bark()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Barking...");
    }
}
```

### Usage

```csharp
var dog = new Dog();
dog.Eat();  // ✅ Inherited from Animal
dog.Bark(); // ✅ Defined in Dog
```

> 🔥 Dog gets everything Animal has — no extra code needed!

## 🎯 Terminology

| Term              | Meaning                                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Base class**    | The class being inherited from                        |
| **Derived class** | The class that inherits                               |
| `:`               | Inheritance keyword (`class B : A`)                   |
| `base`            | Keyword to access the base class from a derived class |

## 🔄 Constructor Chaining with `base`

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name;

    public Person(string name)
    {
        Name = name;
    }
}

public class Student : Person
{
    public int Grade;

    public Student(string name, int grade) : base(name)
    {
        Grade = grade;
    }
}
```

> ✅ `base(name)` calls the base class constructor
> 🔄 Same idea as `this(...)`, but for parent classes

---

## 🔁 Method Overriding

Sometimes you want to **change how an inherited method works**.

### Step 1: Mark base method as `virtual`

```csharp
public class Animal
{
    public virtual void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Some sound...");
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Override it in child

```csharp
public class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Bark!");
    }
}
```

> 🧠 Use `virtual` and `override` for **polymorphism**

---

## 🧰 Calling Base Members from Derived Class

Use `base.` to access members from the parent class:

```csharp
public class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void MakeSound()
    {
        base.MakeSound();  // Call base method
        Console.WriteLine("Also barking...");
    }
}
```

## 🧯 Access Modifiers and Inheritance

| Modifier    | Accessible In Derived? | Notes                       |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `public`    | ✅ Yes                 | Everywhere                  |
| `protected` | ✅ Yes                 | Only inside derived or base |
| `private`   | ❌ No                  | Not inherited directly      |

> 💡 Use `protected` if you want base members to be **accessible but hidden** from the outside.

---

## 🚧 Sealed Class — Block Inheritance

```csharp
public sealed class FinalClass
{
    // Can't be inherited
}
```

> ❌ You **cannot inherit** from a `sealed` class (used to protect final implementations)

---

## 🧠 Interview Insight

> "Inheritance lets us build a natural hierarchy of reusable logic. But it should be used wisely — not everything needs to inherit. Prefer composition unless there's a clear **is-a** relationship."

---

## 🧪 Real-World Analogy

```csharp
class Vehicle { StartEngine() }
class Car : Vehicle { Drive() }
class Truck : Vehicle { HaulLoad() }
```

- A `Car` **is a** `Vehicle`
- A `Truck` **is a** `Vehicle`
- They **share** behavior and **extend** it differently

## ✅ Summary Table

| Concept     | Keyword / Feature  | Purpose                          |
| ----------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Inheritance | `:`                | Create child class from parent   |
| Access base | `base`             | Call base constructor or method  |
| Override    | `virtual/override` | Modify base behavior             |
| Protected   | `protected`        | Share with child but not outside |
| Sealed      | `sealed`           | Prevent further inheritance      |
