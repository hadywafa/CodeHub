# **🚀 Python Method Resolution Order (MRO) - A Complete Guide**

Python's **Method Resolution Order (MRO)** determines **the sequence in which base classes are searched** when calling a method on an object. MRO is crucial in **multiple inheritance** to avoid **ambiguity and ensure method consistency**.

---

## **📌 1. What is MRO (Method Resolution Order)?**

Method Resolution Order (MRO) is **the order in which Python looks for a method in a class hierarchy** when multiple classes are inherited. Python uses **C3 Linearization (C3 MRO Algorithm)** to determine MRO.

### **🔹 Why is MRO Important?**

✅ **Ensures predictable method lookup**  
✅ **Avoids ambiguity in multiple inheritance**  
✅ **Resolves the Diamond Problem** (when a class inherits from two classes that share a common ancestor)

---

## **📌 2. Checking the MRO of a Class**

Python provides two ways to check the MRO of a class:

### **🔹 Using `__mro__` Attribute**

```python
class A: pass
class B(A): pass
class C(A): pass
class D(B, C): pass

print(D.__mro__)
```

**Output:**

```ini
(<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>)
```

✅ **Shows the order in which Python will look for methods in class `D`.**

---

### **🔹 Using `mro()` Method**

```python
print(D.mro())
```

**Output (Same as `__mro__`):**

```ini
[<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>]
```

✅ **`mro()` is a method equivalent to `__mro__` but returns a list.**

---

## **📌 3. How Python Determines MRO (C3 Linearization)**

Python **follows the C3 Linearization Algorithm** to determine MRO:

1️⃣ **Starts from the current class**  
2️⃣ **Checks its parent classes (from left to right in `class Child(Parent1, Parent2)` order)**  
3️⃣ **Moves up to grandparents while ensuring a consistent order**

### **🔹 Example: Multiple Inheritance MRO**

```python
class A:
    def show(self):
        print("A")

class B(A):
    def show(self):
        print("B")

class C(A):
    def show(self):
        print("C")

class D(B, C):  # Multiple inheritance
    pass

d = D()
d.show()  # Which method is called?
```

**Output:**

```ini
B
```

✅ **MRO follows `D → B → C → A` order.**  
✅ **Python prioritizes the leftmost parent class (`B` before `C`).**

---

## **📌 4. The Diamond Problem & MRO**

The **Diamond Problem** occurs when **a class inherits from two classes that share a common ancestor**.

### **🔹 Example of the Diamond Problem**

```python
class A:
    def show(self):
        print("A")

class B(A):
    def show(self):
        print("B")

class C(A):
    def show(self):
        print("C")

class D(B, C):  # Inherits from B and C, which both inherit from A
    pass

d = D()
d.show()  # Which method is called?
```

### **🔹 MRO Resolves the Diamond Problem**

- **MRO of `D`:**

  ```ini
  D → B → C → A → object
  ```

- **`B.show()` is called first because B appears before C in `class D(B, C)`.**

✅ **Python’s MRO ensures that `A` is called only once.**

---

## **📌 5. `super()` and MRO**

The `super()` function **follows MRO** to call parent methods in the correct order.

### **🔹 Example: Using `super()` with MRO**

```python
class A:
    def show(self):
        print("A")

class B(A):
    def show(self):
        print("B")
        super().show()  # Calls next class in MRO

class C(A):
    def show(self):
        print("C")
        super().show()  # Calls next class in MRO

class D(B, C):
    def show(self):
        print("D")
        super().show()  # Calls next class in MRO

d = D()
d.show()
```

**Output:**

```ini
D
B
C
A
```

✅ **`super()` follows MRO to ensure methods are called in the correct order.**

---

## **📌 6. MRO in Single Inheritance**

Even in **single inheritance**, MRO exists:

```python
class A:
    def show(self):
        print("A")

class B(A):
    def show(self):
        print("B")

b = B()
b.show()
```

**MRO:**

```ini
B → A → object
```

✅ **Python always searches from the child class (`B`) up to the parent (`A`).**

---

## **📌 7. MRO in Hybrid Inheritance**

Python allows **combining single, multiple, and hierarchical inheritance**.

### **🔹 Example: Hybrid Inheritance**

```python
class A:
    def show(self):
        print("A")

class B(A):
    def show(self):
        print("B")

class C(A):
    def show(self):
        print("C")

class D(B, C):  # Multiple inheritance
    def show(self):
        print("D")
        super().show()

class E(D):
    def show(self):
        print("E")
        super().show()

e = E()
e.show()
```

**Output:**

```ini
E
D
B
C
A
```

✅ **MRO ensures that each class is only called once, preventing infinite recursion.**

---

## **📌 8. Overriding MRO with `__mro_entries__` (Advanced)**

Python allows **modifying MRO dynamically** with `__mro_entries__`.

```python
class Base:
    def show(self):
        print("Base")

class Mixin:
    def __mro_entries__(self, bases):
        return (Base,)  # Override MRO dynamically

class Child(Mixin, Base):
    pass

print(Child.mro())  # ✅ [Child, Base, object]
```

✅ **Rarely used, but allows dynamic MRO modification.**
