# **🚀 Python Inheritance - A Complete Guide (With C# Comparisons)**

Inheritance in Python is a core concept of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** that allows you to **reuse code**, create **hierarchies of classes**, and establish **relationships between classes**. This guide covers **single inheritance, multiple inheritance, method overriding, super(), and advanced inheritance concepts**.

> **Note for C# Developers:** Python and C# share similar inheritance principles. However, Python has more flexibility with **multiple inheritance** and **dynamic typing**.

---

## **📌 1. What is Inheritance?**

Inheritance allows a class to **derive properties and methods** from another class. The main benefits of inheritance are:

- **Code Reusability:** Avoid repeating code.
- **Hierarchical Relationships:** Establish “is-a” relationships.
- **Extensibility:** Easily extend existing functionality.

---

## **📌 2. Single Inheritance**

Single inheritance is when a class inherits from **one parent class**.

### **🔹 Example in Python:**

```python
# Base class (Parent)
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, brand):
        self.brand = brand

    def start(self):
        print(f"{self.brand} vehicle is starting.")

# Derived class (Child)
class Car(Vehicle):
    def drive(self):
        print(f"{self.brand} car is driving.")

# Creating an instance of Car
my_car = Car("Toyota")
my_car.start()  # Inherited method
my_car.drive()  # Child method
```

### **🔹 C# Equivalent:**

```csharp
// Base class
class Vehicle
{
    public string Brand;

    public Vehicle(string brand)
    {
        Brand = brand;
    }

    public void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{Brand} vehicle is starting.");
    }
}

// Derived class
class Car : Vehicle
{
    public Car(string brand) : base(brand) { }

    public void Drive()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{Brand} car is driving.");
    }
}

Car myCar = new Car("Toyota");
myCar.Start();
myCar.Drive();
```

✅ Python uses the same syntax (`class Child(Parent):`) as C#, but **no need to specify `public`, `private`, or `protected` access modifiers**.

---

## **📌 3. Method Overriding**

Method overriding allows a derived class to **provide a different implementation** of a method inherited from the parent class.

### **🔹 Python Example:**

```python
class Vehicle:
    def start(self):
        print("Vehicle is starting...")

class Car(Vehicle):
    def start(self):
        print("Car is starting...")

my_car = Car()
my_car.start()  # Output: Car is starting...
```

### **🔹 C# Equivalent:**

```csharp
class Vehicle
{
    public virtual void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Vehicle is starting...");
    }
}

class Car : Vehicle
{
    public override void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Car is starting...");
    }
}

Car myCar = new Car();
myCar.Start();  // Output: Car is starting...
```

✅ Python automatically supports method overriding without explicit keywords like `virtual` or `override` in C#.

---

## **📌 4. The `super()` Function**

`super()` is used to call methods from the parent class. This is particularly useful in method overriding.

### **🔹 Python Example:**

```python
class Vehicle:
    def start(self):
        print("Vehicle is starting...")

class Car(Vehicle):
    def start(self):
        super().start()  # Call the parent method
        print("Car is starting...")

my_car = Car()
my_car.start()
```

**Output:**

```ini
Vehicle is starting...
Car is starting...
```

### **🔹 C# Equivalent:**

```csharp
class Vehicle
{
    public virtual void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Vehicle is starting...");
    }
}

class Car : Vehicle
{
    public override void Start()
    {
        base.Start();  // Call the parent method
        Console.WriteLine("Car is starting...");
    }
}
```

✅ `super()` in Python behaves similarly to `base` in C#.

---

## **📌 5. Multiple Inheritance**

Python supports **multiple inheritance**, allowing a class to inherit from more than one parent class.

### **🔹 Python Example:**

```python
class Engine:
    def start_engine(self):
        print("Engine started.")

class Wheels:
    def roll(self):
        print("Wheels rolling.")

class Car(Engine, Wheels):
    def drive(self):
        print("Car is driving.")

my_car = Car()
my_car.start_engine()  # Inherited from Engine
my_car.roll()          # Inherited from Wheels
my_car.drive()         # Defined in Car
```

### **🔹 C# Equivalent:**

C# **does not support multiple inheritance**. Instead, C# uses **interfaces** to achieve similar functionality.

```csharp
interface IEngine
{
    void StartEngine();
}

interface IWheels
{
    void Roll();
}

class Car : IEngine, IWheels
{
    public void StartEngine() => Console.WriteLine("Engine started.");
    public void Roll() => Console.WriteLine("Wheels rolling.");
    public void Drive() => Console.WriteLine("Car is driving.");
}
```

✅ Python's multiple inheritance allows inheriting from multiple classes directly, unlike C#.

---

## **📌 6. Hierarchical Inheritance**

A class can be inherited by multiple subclasses.

```python
class Vehicle:
    def start(self):
        print("Vehicle is starting...")

class Car(Vehicle):
    def drive(self):
        print("Car is driving.")

class Bike(Vehicle):
    def ride(self):
        print("Bike is riding.")

car = Car()
bike = Bike()

car.start()  # Inherited from Vehicle
bike.start()  # Inherited from Vehicle
```

---

## **📌 7. Multilevel Inheritance**

Multilevel inheritance refers to a class inheriting from a class which in turn inherits from another class.

```python
class Vehicle:
    def start(self):
        print("Vehicle is starting...")

class Car(Vehicle):
    def drive(self):
        print("Car is driving.")

class ElectricCar(Car):
    def charge(self):
        print("Electric car is charging.")

tesla = ElectricCar()
tesla.start()   # From Vehicle
tesla.drive()   # From Car
tesla.charge()  # From ElectricCar
```

---

## **📌 8. Diamond Problem and Method Resolution Order (MRO)**

In multiple inheritance, the **diamond problem** occurs when a class inherits from two classes that inherit from the same base class.

### **🔹 Python Example:**

```python
class A:
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello from A")

class B(A):
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello from B")

class C(A):
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello from C")

class D(B, C):
    pass

d = D()
d.greet()
```

**Output:**

```ini
Hello from B
```

✅ Python uses the **Method Resolution Order (MRO)** to resolve method calls in such cases.

---

## **📌 9. Abstract Classes and Inheritance**

Python uses the `abc` module for abstract classes.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Vehicle(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def start(self):
        pass

class Car(Vehicle):
    def start(self):
        print("Car is starting...")

car = Car()
car.start()
```

✅ Similar to **C# abstract classes**, Python requires abstract methods to be implemented in derived classes.
