# üêß **Shebang (`#!`) and Exit Codes in Shell Scripting**

Shell scripts in Linux start with a **shebang (`#!`)**, which defines the interpreter for the script. Additionally, **exit codes** help determine the success or failure of script execution.

---

## üîπ **1. Understanding the Shebang (`#!`)**

The **shebang (`#!`)** is the first line of a shell script and specifies the interpreter that will execute the script.

### ‚úÖ **1.1. Basic Syntax**

```bash
#!/path/to/interpreter
```

For example, to use **Bash** as the interpreter:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, world!"
```

To use **Sh (Bourne shell)**:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
echo "Hello, world!"
```

---

### ‚úÖ **1.2. Why Use a Shebang?**

1. **Specifies the Shell** ‚Äì Ensures that the script runs in the intended shell, avoiding compatibility issues.
2. **Allows Direct Execution** ‚Äì Scripts can be run as executables (`chmod +x script.sh`) without explicitly calling `bash script.sh`.
3. **Enhances Portability** ‚Äì Scripts work across systems without requiring users to specify an interpreter manually.

### ‚úÖ **1.3. Common Shebang Variations**

| Shebang               | Interpreter             | Usage                                          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `#!/bin/bash`         | Bash shell              | Most commonly used                             |
| `#!/bin/sh`           | Bourne shell            | Portable but may not support all Bash features |
| `#!/usr/bin/env bash` | Uses environment's Bash | More portable across different UNIX systems    |
| `#!/usr/bin/python3`  | Python 3 interpreter    | Used for Python scripts                        |
| `#!/usr/bin/perl`     | Perl interpreter        | Used for Perl scripts                          |

---

### ‚úÖ **1.4. Making a Script Executable with Shebang**

```bash
chmod +x myscript.sh
./myscript.sh
```

Without a shebang, running `./myscript.sh` may fail or execute in an unintended shell.

---

## üîπ **2. Understanding Exit Codes in Shell Scripting**

An **exit code** (also called an **exit status**) is a numerical value that a script returns upon execution. It helps determine whether the script ran successfully or encountered an error.

---

### ‚úÖ **2.1. Checking Exit Codes**

After executing a command, the exit code is stored in the special variable **`$?`**.

```bash
ls /home
echo "Exit Code: $?"  # 0 (Success)
```

```bash
ls /invalid_directory
echo "Exit Code: $?"  # Non-zero (Failure)
```

---

### ‚úÖ **2.2. Exit Code Conventions**

| Exit Code | Meaning                            |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `0`       | Success (no error)                 |
| `1`       | General error                      |
| `2`       | Misuse of built-in commands        |
| `126`     | Command invoked but cannot execute |
| `127`     | Command not found                  |
| `128`     | Invalid exit argument              |
| `130`     | Script terminated with Ctrl+C      |
| `255`     | Exit status out of range           |

---

### ‚úÖ **2.3. Using `exit` to Set Exit Codes**

You can define custom exit codes in your script using `exit <code>`.

#### **Example: Exiting with a Custom Code**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Processing..."
exit 5
```

```bash
./myscript.sh
echo $?  # Output: 5
```

---

### ‚úÖ **2.4. Conditional Execution with Exit Codes**

#### **Example: Handling Command Success or Failure**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

mkdir /test_folder

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Directory created successfully."
else
    echo "Failed to create directory."
fi
```

#### **Example: Using `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR) with Exit Codes**

```bash
mkdir /test_folder && echo "Success" || echo "Failure"
```

- `&&` executes the second command **only if** the first command succeeds.
- `||` executes the second command **only if** the first command fails.

---

## üîπ **3. Real-World Example: Error Handling in Scripts**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter a filename:"
read filename

if [ ! -f "$filename" ]; then
    echo "Error: File not found!"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Processing file: $filename"
```

- If the file exists, it processes it.
- If the file doesn't exist, the script exits with code `1`.

| Feature                       | Syntax                  | Purpose                                |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Shebang (`#!`)**            | `#!/bin/bash`           | Defines the shell for the script       |
| **Exit Code Variable**        | `$?`                    | Holds the last command's exit status   |
| **Success Code**              | `0`                     | Indicates successful execution         |
| **Failure Code**              | `1` or higher           | Indicates an error                     |
| **Custom Exit Code**          | `exit <code>`           | Manually sets an exit status           |
| **Check Exit Code in Script** | `if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then` | Runs commands based on success/failure |
