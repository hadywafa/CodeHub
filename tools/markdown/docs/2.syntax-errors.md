# Syntax Error Notes

- Mermaid syntax requires quoted labels when the text includes parentheses, spaces, or special characters.
- markdown language only supported in some mermaid diagrams. For example, flowcharts but sequence diagrams do not.
- Don't use _node_ as class name, it is reserved word in mermaid.js
- Use `classDef` to define styles and `class` to apply them to specific nodes.
- Use `-.->` for dashed arrows in flowcharts.
- Use `subgraph` to group related nodes together.
- Use `config` block for global settings like theme and appearance.
- Use `---` to separate configuration and diagram sections in Mermaid.
- Always test Mermaid diagrams in a Mermaid live editor to ensure correctness.
- For complex diagrams, break them into smaller parts and combine them later.
