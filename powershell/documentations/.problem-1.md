# **üîß Debugging Docker Port Binding Issues on Windows (Port 3306 Error)**

## **üõ† Problem**

When running `docker-compose up -d`, you may encounter the error:

```
Error response from daemon: Ports are not available: exposing port TCP 0.0.0.0:3306 -> 0.0.0.0:0: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:3306: bind: An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions.
```

Even though running:

```powershell
Get-NetTCPConnection | Where-Object {$_.LocalPort -eq 3306}
```

shows **no process is using port 3306**, Docker still refuses to bind to it.

---

## **üîç Debugging the Issue**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Check if Port 3306 is In Use**

Run:

```powershell
Get-NetTCPConnection | Where-Object {$_.LocalPort -eq 3306}
```

or for remote connections:

```powershell
Get-NetTCPConnection | Where-Object {$_.RemotePort -eq 3306}
```

- **If the command shows an active process:** Another application (e.g., MySQL service) is using the port.
- **If nothing is shown but Docker still fails:** The port may be cached or reserved by Windows NAT (WinNAT).

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Check for Reserved Ports in Windows**

Windows sometimes **reserves ports** even if no process is actively using them. Run:

```powershell
netsh interface ipv4 show excludedportrange protocol=tcp
```

If **port 3306 is listed**, Windows has reserved it, and Docker cannot bind to it.

---

## **üöÄ Solutions**

### ‚úÖ **1. Restart WinNAT to Release Cached Port Bindings**

Run:

```powershell
net stop winnat
net start winnat
```

This forces Windows to clear **cached NAT port bindings**, allowing Docker to rebind to **port 3306**.

---

### ‚úÖ **2. Stop Any Conflicting MySQL Service**

If MySQL is installed natively on Windows, stop it:

```powershell
net stop MySQL80
```

or:

```powershell
sc stop MySQL80
```

---

### ‚úÖ **3. Restart Docker**

```powershell
Restart-Service docker
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

---

### ‚úÖ **4. Use a Different Port (Workaround)**

Modify `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
ports:
  - "3307:3306" # Use external port 3307 instead
```

Then connect using:

```powershell
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3307 -u root -p
```

| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Port 3306 appears free but Docker says it's in use** | WinNAT caching stale port bindings    | Restart WinNAT (`net stop winnat && net start winnat`)                                          |
| **Another process is using port 3306**                 | MySQL or another service is running   | Stop MySQL (`net stop MySQL80`) or use `Get-NetTCPConnection` to find the process               |
| **Port is reserved by Windows**                        | Windows has pre-allocated port 3306   | Check with `netsh interface ipv4 show excludedportrange` and restart the system                 |
| **Docker still fails after stopping MySQL**            | Docker needs a restart                | Restart Docker (`Restart-Service docker`) and use `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d` |
| **Persistent issues**                                  | Some other app or Windows reservation | Use `3307:3306` instead of `3306:3306` in `docker-compose.yml`                                  |

### ‚úÖ **Best Practices**

- Always **stop** MySQL properly before using Docker.
- Run `Get-NetTCPConnection` and `netsh interface ipv4 show excludedportrange` to debug port conflicts.
- If **WinNAT caching** is the issue, restart it using `net stop winnat && net start winnat`.
- Consider **changing the external port** if you frequently face conflicts.

### **üì¢ Final Notes**

If you still face issues after these steps, **restart your computer** to clear any lingering reserved ports.
