# üõ°Ô∏è **Understanding PowerShell Execution Policy**

## üìå **Introduction**

PowerShell's execution policy is a security feature designed to prevent malicious scripts from running automatically. It controls whether scripts can be executed on your system and under what conditions.

By default, PowerShell restricts script execution to protect users from running potentially harmful scripts. However, this can sometimes cause issues, especially when trying to run custom scripts like your PowerShell profile.

## üèóÔ∏è **Basics of PowerShell Execution Policy**

### üîπ **What is Execution Policy?**

Execution Policy is a set of rules in PowerShell that determines how scripts can be executed on a system. It does **not** enforce security but acts as a safeguard to prevent unintended script execution.

### üîπ **Types of Execution Policies**

There are **five main execution policies** in PowerShell:

| Execution Policy | Description                                                                             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Restricted**   | No scripts are allowed to run. Only interactive commands are permitted.                 |
| **AllSigned**    | Only scripts signed by a trusted publisher can run.                                     |
| **RemoteSigned** | Local scripts can run without a signature, but downloaded scripts must be signed.       |
| **Unrestricted** | All scripts can run without any restrictions. A warning appears for downloaded scripts. |
| **Bypass**       | No restrictions. PowerShell runs any script without warnings.                           |

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Checking the Current Execution Policy**

To check the current execution policy, open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
Get-ExecutionPolicy -List
```

This command displays policies set at different scopes.

---

## üìç **Understanding Execution Policy Scopes**

Execution policies can be set at different **scopes**, which determine where the policy applies.

| Scope             | Applies To                                           |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **MachinePolicy** | System-wide policy set via Group Policy.             |
| **UserPolicy**    | User-specific policy set via Group Policy.           |
| **LocalMachine**  | Policy applied to all users on the computer.         |
| **CurrentUser**   | Policy applied only to the current logged-in user.   |
| **Process**       | Temporary policy for the current PowerShell session. |

## üõ†Ô∏è **Fixing Execution Policy Errors**

### üîπ **Common Error Message**

If your PowerShell profile script fails to load with an error like this:

```
File C:\Users\YourName\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 cannot be loaded.
The file is not digitally signed. You cannot run this script on the current system.
```

It means your execution policy is set to **AllSigned**, which requires all scripts to be signed.

---

## üöÄ **Changing Execution Policy**

### üèÜ **Recommended Solution: Set Execution Policy to RemoteSigned**

To allow local scripts while keeping some security, set the policy to **RemoteSigned**:

üîπ Open **PowerShell as Administrator**  
üîπ Run this command:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine
```

üîπ Confirm with **Y** and press **Enter**.

Now, local scripts will run, and downloaded scripts must be signed.

---

## üéØ **Other Execution Policy Options**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Temporarily Bypass Execution Policy (For Current Session)**

If you don‚Äôt want to change the policy permanently, you can bypass it temporarily:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
```

This setting is valid **only for the current session** and resets when you close PowerShell.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Change Execution Policy for Only Your User**

If you don't want to affect all users, apply the policy **only to your user**:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Unblock a Specific Script**

If you want to keep `AllSigned` but need to allow a single script, manually unblock it:

```powershell
Unblock-File -Path "C:\Users\YourName\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1"
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **Advanced: Digitally Signing Scripts (Optional)**

If your policy is `AllSigned`, you must sign scripts with a trusted certificate.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Generate a self-signed certificate:

```powershell
New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName "MyScript" -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My"
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Use the certificate to sign your script:

```powershell
Set-AuthenticodeSignature -FilePath "C:\path\to\script.ps1" -Certificate (Get-ChildItem Cert:\CurrentUser\My -CodeSigningCert)
```

This is more complex but ensures security.

---

## üîÑ **Verifying the Execution Policy Change**

After modifying the policy, confirm it with:

```powershell
Get-ExecutionPolicy -List
```

You should see `RemoteSigned` or the policy you applied.

---

## üéØ **Conclusion**

PowerShell execution policies provide a balance between **security and flexibility**.

- **Restricted** = No scripts run (Most secure üö´)
- **AllSigned** = Only signed scripts run ‚úÖ
- **RemoteSigned** = Local scripts run, downloaded ones need a signature (Best for most users ‚ö°)
- **Unrestricted** / **Bypass** = All scripts run (Least secure ‚ö†Ô∏è)

By setting your execution policy correctly, you can ensure **both safety and usability** for your PowerShell environment. üöÄ
