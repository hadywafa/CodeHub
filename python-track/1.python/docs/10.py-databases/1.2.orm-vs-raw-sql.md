# **Raw SQL vs ORM in Python: What Big Companies Do & How to Choose the Right Approach**

## **Introduction**

When working with databases in Python, you have two primary approaches:

1. **Using an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM)** ‚Äì A high-level abstraction that allows developers to interact with the database using Python objects and methods.
2. **Using Raw SQL (via `asyncpg`, `psycopg3`, or `sqlite3`)** ‚Äì Directly executing SQL queries for fine-tuned performance and control.

Many big companies like **Facebook, Netflix, and Uber** use a combination of both ORM and raw SQL depending on the use case. In this guide, we will explore:

- The advantages and disadvantages of ORMs and raw SQL.
- How companies decide which approach to use.
- Best practices to follow when choosing between them.

## **1. What is an ORM?**

An **Object-Relational Mapper (ORM)** is a tool that lets you interact with a database using Python objects instead of writing SQL queries manually.

Popular ORMs in Python:

- **SQLAlchemy** (most flexible, supports both ORM and raw SQL)
- **Django ORM** (popular for Django projects)
- **Tortoise ORM** (async ORM for FastAPI and asyncio projects)
- **Pony ORM** (lightweight and declarative)

Example of ORM usage (SQLAlchemy):

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = "users"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    age = Column(Integer)

# Database connection
engine = create_engine("sqlite:///example.db")
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

# Insert a user
new_user = User(name="Alice", age=25)
session.add(new_user)
session.commit()

# Query a user
user = session.query(User).filter_by(name="Alice").first()
print(user.age)
```

This avoids writing raw SQL queries and improves maintainability.

---

## **2. What is Raw SQL?**

Raw SQL means executing queries directly using a database driver like `asyncpg`, `psycopg3`, or `sqlite3`.

Example using `asyncpg` (for PostgreSQL):

```python
import asyncpg
import asyncio

async def fetch_users():
    conn = await asyncpg.connect("postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname")
    users = await conn.fetch("SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > $1", 18)
    await conn.close()
    return users

asyncio.run(fetch_users())
```

This approach provides full control over queries, execution plans, and optimizations.

## **3. Pros & Cons of ORM vs. Raw SQL**

### **ORM (SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, etc.)**

‚úÖ **Advantages:**

1. **Productivity & Maintainability** ‚Äì No need to write repetitive SQL queries.
2. **Security** ‚Äì ORM uses parameterized queries, reducing SQL injection risks.
3. **Database Abstraction** ‚Äì Can switch between PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite without rewriting queries.
4. **Schema Migrations** ‚Äì Tools like Alembic allow version-controlled database changes.
5. **Integration with Business Logic** ‚Äì Easier to map database tables to Python objects.

‚ùå **Disadvantages:**

1. **Performance Overhead** ‚Äì ORMs generate SQL dynamically, which may not always be optimized.
2. **Complex Queries Can Be Hard** ‚Äì ORMs struggle with advanced joins, window functions, and recursive queries.
3. **Extra Learning Curve** ‚Äì Developers need to learn ORM quirks (lazy/eager loading, session management).

---

### **Raw SQL (`asyncpg`, `psycopg3`, etc.)**

‚úÖ **Advantages:**

1. **Better Performance** ‚Äì Direct execution of optimized queries.
2. **Full SQL Control** ‚Äì Can use database-specific optimizations (e.g., `JSONB`, `GIN indexes` in PostgreSQL).
3. **No ORM Overhead** ‚Äì Avoids unnecessary joins and complex ORM mappings.
4. **Fine-Tuned Query Optimization** ‚Äì Can analyze execution plans for better indexing.

‚ùå **Disadvantages:**

1. **More Code to Maintain** ‚Äì Requires manually writing queries and managing schema changes.
2. **Potential Security Risks** ‚Äì Developers must handle SQL injection protection manually.
3. **Less Portability** ‚Äì SQL queries may need rewriting when switching databases.

## **4. What Big Companies Do**

### **Hybrid Approach (ORM + Raw SQL)**

Many large-scale applications use **a combination of ORM and raw SQL**:

- Use ORM for **CRUD operations** (creating, reading, updating, deleting records).
- Use raw SQL for **performance-critical queries** (bulk inserts, analytics, reporting).

**Company Strategies:**

| Company      | Approach Used                                                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Facebook** | Uses ORM (Django ORM) but rewrites critical queries in raw SQL                  |
| **Netflix**  | Uses ORM for maintainability but switches to raw SQL for analytics & reporting  |
| **Uber**     | Uses SQLAlchemy ORM + raw SQL for microservices and performance tuning          |
| **Airbnb**   | Prefers ORM for general app logic but uses raw SQL for high-performance queries |

Example: Uber uses **SQLAlchemy ORM** but also **raw SQL with asyncpg** for high-performance queries in its microservices.

## **5. How to Decide Which One to Use?**

### **Use ORM if:**

‚úî You want **rapid development** with minimal database concerns.  
‚úî Your queries are **simple to moderately complex**.  
‚úî You are working on a **Django/FastAPI application** that needs portability.  
‚úî You need **automatic schema migrations**.

### **Use Raw SQL if:**

‚úî Your application has **high performance requirements**.  
‚úî You have **very complex SQL queries** (e.g., recursive CTEs, custom indexing strategies).  
‚úî You need **real-time analytics or bulk data processing**.  
‚úî You want **full control over query execution plans**.

### **Use Both (Hybrid) if:**

‚úî You want the convenience of ORM but need **optimized SQL for critical operations**.  
‚úî You‚Äôre building **microservices** and need flexibility in how queries are written.  
‚úî You need ORM for **business logic** and raw SQL for **data-intensive tasks**.

## **6. Best Practices for Using ORM & Raw SQL**

### **When Using ORM:**

- Use **eager loading** (`join`) to prevent "N+1 query" problems.
- Optimize queries using **indexes and prefetching**.
- Use **session management properly** to avoid excessive memory usage.

Example of ORM with eager loading:

```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import joinedload

session.query(User).options(joinedload(User.orders)).all()
```

---

### **When Using Raw SQL:**

- Always use **parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection.
- Use **connection pooling** (`asyncpg.pool`) to improve performance.
- Profile queries with **EXPLAIN ANALYZE** to optimize execution.

Example of safe raw SQL:

```python
async def get_user(conn, user_id):
    return await conn.fetchrow("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1", user_id)
```

## **7. Conclusion**

| Feature         | ORM (SQLAlchemy, Django ORM)  | Raw SQL (asyncpg, psycopg3)    |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Performance** | Slower for complex queries    | Fast, optimized execution      |
| **Ease of Use** | Easier, high-level API        | More effort, direct SQL        |
| **Security**    | Safer, prevents SQL injection | Requires manual validation     |
| **Flexibility** | Good for general queries      | Better for complex queries     |
| **Portability** | Works with multiple databases | Tied to a specific SQL dialect |

üîπ **For most web apps, an ORM is the best starting point.**  
üîπ **For large-scale, high-performance apps, a hybrid approach works best.**  
üîπ **For analytics, reporting, and high-load queries, raw SQL is superior.**

## **Final Thoughts**

To build scalable applications like **Uber, Netflix, and Airbnb**, start with ORM for maintainability but be ready to use raw SQL for performance-critical operations.
