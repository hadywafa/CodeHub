# **🚀 Class Methods vs. Static Methods in Python - A Complete Guide**

In Python, both **class methods** and **static methods** are used to define methods that are not tied to an instance of a class. However, they serve **different purposes** and have key differences in how they work.

---

## **📌 1. Understanding Class Methods (`@classmethod`)**

A **class method** is a method that **operates on the class itself** rather than on an instance. It is **decorated with `@classmethod`**, and it **receives the class (`cls`) as its first parameter**.

### **🔹 Key Features of Class Methods**

✅ Works on the **class level**, not on individual instances  
✅ Can **modify class attributes**  
✅ Receives the **class (`cls`) as the first argument** instead of `self`  
✅ Useful for creating factory methods

### **🔹 Example: Using a Class Method**

```python
class Car:
    wheels = 4  # Class attribute (shared by all instances)

    def __init__(self, brand):
        self.brand = brand  # Instance attribute

    @classmethod
    def change_wheels(cls, new_wheel_count):
        cls.wheels = new_wheel_count  # Modifying the class attribute

# Modify the class attribute using the class method
Car.change_wheels(6)
print(Car.wheels)  # ✅ 6 (Changed for all instances)
```

✅ **Changes made by `@classmethod` affect the class and all instances.**

---

## **📌 2. Understanding Static Methods (`@staticmethod`)**

A **static method** is a method that does not depend on instance (`self`) or class (`cls`). It is **decorated with `@staticmethod`** and **acts like a regular function inside a class**.

### **🔹 Key Features of Static Methods**

✅ Does **not access instance (`self`) or class (`cls`)**  
✅ Behaves like a normal function inside the class  
✅ Used for utility/helper functions related to the class  
✅ Does **not modify class or instance attributes**

### **🔹 Example: Using a Static Method**

```python
class Car:
    @staticmethod
    def general_info():
        return "Cars have engines and wheels."

# Call static method without creating an instance
print(Car.general_info())  # ✅ Cars have engines and wheels.
```

✅ **A static method does not depend on the class or instance variables.**

## **📌 3. Key Differences Between Class Methods and Static Methods**

| Feature                         | Class Method (`@classmethod`)       | Static Method (`@staticmethod`)            |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Access to Instance (`self`)** | ❌ No                               | ❌ No                                      |
| **Access to Class (`cls`)**     | ✅ Yes                              | ❌ No                                      |
| **Modifies Class Attributes**   | ✅ Yes                              | ❌ No                                      |
| **Instance Required?**          | ❌ No                               | ❌ No                                      |
| **Usage**                       | Modify class state, factory methods | Utility functions unrelated to class state |

---

## **📌 4. Example: When to Use Class Methods vs. Static Methods**

### **🔹 Example: Factory Method with `@classmethod`**

Factory methods **create instances with default values**.

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, fuel_type):
        self.brand = brand
        self.fuel_type = fuel_type

    @classmethod
    def electric_car(cls, brand):
        return cls(brand, "Electric")  # Creates an instance with default fuel type

# Creating a new car using the class method
tesla = Car.electric_car("Tesla")
print(tesla.brand, tesla.fuel_type)  # ✅ Tesla Electric
```

✅ **Class methods are useful for factory patterns where default values are required.**

---

### **🔹 Example: Utility Method with `@staticmethod`**

Static methods are used for **helper functions**.

```python
class MathUtils:
    @staticmethod
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

print(MathUtils.add(5, 3))  # ✅ 8
```

✅ **Static methods are used for simple operations that don’t rely on the class or instance.**

---

## **📌 5. Using `@classmethod` and `@staticmethod` Together**

Sometimes, both methods are used in a class for different purposes.

```python
class Employee:
    company_name = "TechCorp"

    def __init__(self, name, salary):
        self.name = name
        self.salary = salary

    @classmethod
    def change_company(cls, new_name):
        cls.company_name = new_name  # Modify class attribute

    @staticmethod
    def is_valid_salary(salary):
        return salary > 3000  # Returns True if salary is valid

# Modify class attribute
Employee.change_company("InnoTech")

# Validate salary using static method
print(Employee.is_valid_salary(3500))  # ✅ True
```

✅ **Class methods modify the class, while static methods perform standalone tasks.**

## **📌 6. When to Use Class Methods vs. Static Methods?**

| **Scenario**                                                | **Use Class Method (`@classmethod`)** | **Use Static Method (`@staticmethod`)** |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Need to modify class variables                              | ✅ Yes                                | ❌ No                                   |
| Need access to `cls` (class itself)                         | ✅ Yes                                | ❌ No                                   |
| Need access to `self` (instance)                            | ❌ No                                 | ❌ No                                   |
| Utility/helper function that does not depend on class state | ❌ No                                 | ✅ Yes                                  |
| Factory method that returns new instances                   | ✅ Yes                                | ❌ No                                   |

## **📌 7. Summary**

- **`@classmethod`** → Works on the class (`cls`) and can modify class-level attributes.
- **`@staticmethod`** → Does not access class or instance; behaves like a regular function inside a class.

✅ **Use `@classmethod` when you need to work with class variables.**  
✅ **Use `@staticmethod` for utility/helper functions that do not depend on class or instance.**
