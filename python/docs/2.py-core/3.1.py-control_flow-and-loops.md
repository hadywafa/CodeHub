# **🚀 Python Control Flow & Loops - A Complete Guide**

Control flow and loops are fundamental to **decision-making, iteration, and automating repetitive tasks** in Python. This guide covers **conditional statements (`if-elif-else`), loops (`for`, `while`), loop control statements (`break`, `continue`, `pass`), and best practices**.

---

## **📌 1. Conditional Statements (`if-elif-else`)**

Conditional statements **execute different code blocks** based on conditions.

### **🔹 Basic `if` Statement**

```python
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
```

✅ **If the condition is `True`, the indented block executes.**

---

### **🔹 `if-else` Statement**

```python
temperature = 25

if temperature > 30:
    print("It's hot outside!")
else:
    print("It's a pleasant day.")
```

✅ If the condition in `if` is **False**, the `else` block executes.

---

### **🔹 `if-elif-else` (Multiple Conditions)**

```python
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 75:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 50:
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: F")
```

✅ **Multiple `elif` conditions allow more control.**

---

### **🔹 Nested `if` Statements**

```python
age = 20
is_student = True

if age >= 18:
    if is_student:
        print("Eligible for student discount.")
    else:
        print("No discount.")
```

✅ **Avoid too much nesting** to keep the code readable.

---

### **🔹 Short-Hand (Ternary Operator)**

```python
age = 16
status = "Adult" if age >= 18 else "Minor"
print(status)  # Minor
```

✅ **Use ternary operators for compact conditional statements.**

---

## **📌 2. Loops in Python (For & While)**

Loops allow executing code **multiple times**.

---

## **🟢 `for` Loop (Iterating Over Sequences)**

### **🔹 Looping Over a List**

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

✅ **Iterates through each element** in the list.

---

### **🔹 Using `range()` in `for` Loop**

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # 0 1 2 3 4
```

✅ **`range(n)` generates numbers from `0` to `n-1`.**

---

### **🔹 Loop with `range(start, stop, step)`**

```python
for i in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(i)  # 1 3 5 7 9
```

✅ **Custom step size controls iteration.**

---

### **🔹 Looping Through a String**

```python
word = "Python"
for char in word:
    print(char)
```

✅ **Each character in the string is processed separately.**

---

### **🔹 Using `enumerate()` for Index & Value**

```python
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
for index, name in enumerate(names):
    print(f"{index}: {name}")
```

✅ **`enumerate()` helps access index and value together.**

---

## **🟢 `while` Loop (Repeating Until a Condition is Met)**

A `while` loop **executes as long as the condition remains `True`.**

### **🔹 Basic `while` Loop**

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

✅ **Make sure to update the condition, or the loop runs infinitely!**

---

### **🔹 Using `while` for User Input**

```python
password = ""
while password != "1234":
    password = input("Enter password: ")
print("Access Granted")
```

✅ **Keeps asking for input until the correct password is entered.**

---

### **🔹 Infinite Loop (With `break`)**

```python
while True:
    user_input = input("Type 'exit' to stop: ")
    if user_input == "exit":
        break
```

✅ **Used for interactive programs like chatbots.**

---

## **📌 3. Loop Control Statements (`break`, `continue`, `pass`)**

---

### **🔹 `break` (Exit Loop Immediately)**

```python
for num in range(10):
    if num == 5:
        break  # Stops the loop at 5
    print(num)
```

✅ **Stops execution of the loop completely.**

---

### **🔹 `continue` (Skip Current Iteration)**

```python
for num in range(5):
    if num == 2:
        continue  # Skip 2
    print(num)
```

✅ **Skips iteration when `num == 2`, but loop continues.**

---

### **🔹 `pass` (Placeholder Statement)**

```python
for num in range(3):
    pass  # Do nothing (placeholder)
```

✅ **Used when a loop or function needs to exist but isn’t implemented yet.**

---

## **📌 4. Nested Loops**

A loop **inside another loop**.

### **🔹 Nested `for` Loop**

```python
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(3):
        print(f"i={i}, j={j}")
```

✅ **Creates a grid-like iteration (useful for matrices).**

---

### **🔹 Nested `while` Loop**

```python
i = 1
while i <= 3:
    j = 1
    while j <= 2:
        print(f"i={i}, j={j}")
        j += 1
    i += 1
```

✅ **Used in games, simulations, and multi-dimensional data processing.**

---

## **📌 5. `else` in Loops**

Loops can have an **`else` block**, which runs when the loop completes **without hitting `break`**.

### **🔹 Example: Using `else` with `for`**

```python
for num in range(5):
    print(num)
else:
    print("Loop completed.")
```

✅ **Runs the `else` block when the loop completes normally.**

---

### **🔹 Example: Using `else` with `while`**

```python
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print(count)
    count += 1
else:
    print("Loop ended successfully.")
```

✅ **If `break` is used, the `else` block won’t execute.**

---

## **📌 6. Best Practices for Loops & Control Flow**

✅ **Use `break` carefully** to prevent unwanted infinite loops.  
✅ **Use `continue` sparingly** to avoid skipping essential logic.  
✅ **Prefer `for` loops for iterating over sequences.**  
✅ **Use `while` loops when condition-driven repetition is needed.**  
✅ **Avoid deep nesting**—use functions to simplify logic.
