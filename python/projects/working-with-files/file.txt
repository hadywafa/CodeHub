Mohamed Salah sprinted down the wing,
his Egyptian pace leaving the defender in the dust.
As he approached the box, he feigned a shot, sending the entire stadium into a frenzy.
The crowd, a sea of red, held its collective breath as the Liverpool star danced past another defender.
Finally, with a swift flick of his boot, the ball was in the back of the net. The stadium erupted in joy, 
the Liverpool faithful screaming "Mo- Salah!" as the Egyptian King celebrated his 20th goal of the season.
